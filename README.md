## Implementing rearrange mehod of einops from scratch

### Approach:

I have tried to implement the rearrange method from einops in the most efficient way, with proper error handling and with proper support for complex patterns and edge cases.

I have reiterated over this process to handle all cases to the best of my knowledge.

- My initial approach was to keep everything modular, but that turned out not to be the best decision, as I tried creating a transpose() method just for handling vanilla transpose conditions, but that didn't produce much of a difference in terms of the time taken to execute.

- So, the idea was to modularize the code wherever possible, and do it only if neccessary.
